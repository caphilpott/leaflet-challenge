Visualizing Data with Leaflet 

This exercise was a good challenge in bringing together many of the touch points covered in the last week. I was able to use the crime scene activity for starter code in the logic.js file.

Having to review and understand our JSON data source gave me more practice at the art of scraping JSON data. I initially drilled down to the geometry lay to get coordinates and then realized I'd need the magnitude and other properties from the properties section. 

This lead me to build a "features" aray so I could draw from both the geometry and properties segment. 

I used our soccer team activity to aid in the design of the circle color and size requirements. 

I tweaked the depth ranges slightly from our homework sample output to capture more subtle changes in earth quake depth. I used a multiple of magnitude to change the circle size. 

I threw in five bound popups to provide some well rounded general info about each quake. 

The legend examples from our class work were difficult for me to translate into something useful for this assignment. I ended up modeling my legend setup (in logic.js and style.css) based of a really cool example applied over the Copenhagen, Denmark region (https://codepen.io/haakseth/pen/KQbjdO).

Fun assignment!

Watch out for what's shaking!
